# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the transformation of a comprehensive content management system from a complex, over-engineered architecture to a streamlined, senior-level production-ready application. The transformation focuses on reducing code complexity while maintaining functionality, implementing modern best practices, and creating an impressive codebase that demonstrates senior-level development skills to hiring managers.

The current system features multi-tenant architecture, dual API support (REST + GraphQL), extensive service layer (21 services), complex data models with versioning, plugin system, and workflow engine. The goal is to modernize the technology stack, consolidate services, improve code quality, and enhance performance while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

5. WHEN schemas are defined THEN they SHALL be lean and focused without over-engineering
6. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL implement proper connection pooling

### Requirement 2: Architecture Simplification

**User Story:** As a hiring manager reviewing code, I want to see a clean, well-organized architecture with consolidated services, so that I can quickly understand the system's structure and assess the developer's architectural skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are consolidated THEN the system SHALL reduce from 21 services to 8 core services maximum
2. WHEN the AuthService is implemented THEN it SHALL handle authentication, authorization, and JWT management
3. WHEN the TenantService is implemented THEN it SHALL manage multi-tenancy and user management
4. WHEN the ContentService is implemented THEN it SHALL handle content CRUD, versioning, and publishing
5. WHEN the MediaService is implemented THEN it SHALL manage file uploads, processing, and CDN integration
6. WHEN the SearchService is implemented THEN it SHALL provide full-text search, filtering, and indexing
7. WHEN the WebhookService is implemented THEN it SHALL handle event-driven notifications
8. WHEN the CacheService is implemented THEN it SHALL manage Redis caching and performance optimization
9. WHEN the AuditService is implemented THEN it SHALL handle logging, monitoring, and analytics

### Requirement 3: Code Quality and Senior-Level Patterns

**User Story:** As a senior developer, I want to implement industry-standard design patterns and best practices, so that the codebase demonstrates advanced software engineering skills and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Repository pattern is implemented THEN it SHALL work seamlessly with Drizzle ORM
2. WHEN dependency injection is used THEN the system SHALL use a modern DI container like tsyringe
3. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow SOLID principles throughout the application
4. WHEN validation and authentication are needed THEN the system SHALL use custom decorators
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper error boundaries
6. WHEN error handling is performed THEN the system SHALL use Result/Either pattern for type-safe error handling
7. WHEN TypeScript is configured THEN it SHALL use strict mode with maximum type safety

### Requirement 4: API Layer Enhancement and Performance

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want a unified, high-performance API gateway that supports both REST and GraphQL, so that I can efficiently interact with the system regardless of my preferred API style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL provide a single entry point for both REST and GraphQL
2. WHEN rate limiting is needed THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting mechanisms
3. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL support request/response transformation
4. WHEN API versioning is required THEN the system SHALL implement a clear versioning strategy
5. WHEN data validation is performed THEN the system SHALL use Zod for runtime validation
6. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL be 50% faster than the current implementation
7. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL be reduced by 70% through proper caching

### Requirement 5: Modern Tooling and Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer working on this project, I want modern development tools and fast feedback loops, so that I can be productive and the codebase demonstrates current industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL use Fastify instead of Express for 3x better performance
2. WHEN code is linted and formatted THEN the system SHALL use Biome instead of ESLint/Prettier
3. WHEN development is active THEN the system SHALL implement hot reloading with tsx
4. WHEN TypeScript is configured THEN it SHALL use comprehensive strict mode settings
5. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL use Vitest for faster test execution than Jest
6. WHEN development server starts THEN it SHALL provide sub-second hot reloading
7. WHEN database queries are written THEN they SHALL have auto-complete support

### Requirement 6: Production-Ready Scalability Features

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want production-ready features for scalability and monitoring, so that the application can handle enterprise-level workloads and provide operational visibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN background jobs are needed THEN the system SHALL use Bull Queue for job processing
2. WHEN session management is required THEN the system SHALL use Redis for session storage
3. WHEN caching is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive caching strategies
4. WHEN database performance is optimized THEN queries SHALL be properly indexed and optimized
5. WHEN HTTP responses are sent THEN they SHALL include compression and security headers
6. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging and analytics
7. WHEN the system scales THEN it SHALL support horizontal scaling patterns

### Requirement 7: Clean Project Structure and Organization

**User Story:** As a developer joining the project, I want a clear, intuitive project structure, so that I can quickly understand the codebase organization and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project structure is organized THEN it SHALL follow a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. WHEN core functionality is implemented THEN it SHALL be organized in a dedicated core directory
3. WHEN business logic is implemented THEN it SHALL be organized in feature-based modules
4. WHEN shared functionality is needed THEN it SHALL be properly organized in a shared directory
5. WHEN API endpoints are defined THEN they SHALL be clearly separated between REST and GraphQL
6. WHEN database schemas are defined THEN they SHALL be organized with proper migrations
7. WHEN the codebase is reviewed THEN it SHALL demonstrate senior-level organization and structure

### Requirement 8: Code Reduction and Quality Metrics

**User Story:** As a hiring manager, I want to see efficient, high-quality code that accomplishes more with less, so that I can assess the developer's ability to write maintainable, production-ready software.

#### Acceptance Criteria
