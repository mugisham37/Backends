# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project transformation aims to modernize an existing Express.js e-commerce backend by reducing code complexity by 60-70% while maintaining all functionality. The transformation will migrate from MongoDB/Mongoose to PostgreSQL/Drizzle ORM, implement clean architecture patterns, add GraphQL alongside REST APIs, and reorganize the codebase to impress hiring managers with modern development practices and enterprise-level code quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Migration and ORM Modernization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from MongoDB/Mongoose to PostgreSQL/Drizzle ORM, so that I have better type safety, performance, and modern SQL capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL as the primary database
2. WHEN using Drizzle ORM THEN the system SHALL have full TypeScript type safety for all database operations
3. WHEN performing database queries THEN the system SHALL achieve 40-60% better performance compared to MongoDB
4. WHEN defining schemas THEN the system SHALL use Drizzle's schema-first approach with proper migrations
5. IF complex relationships exist THEN the system SHALL leverage SQL joins and foreign keys for data integrity

### Requirement 2: Code Quality and Architecture Improvement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to reduce verbose code patterns and implement clean architecture, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows modern best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring controllers THEN the system SHALL reduce controller files from 500+ lines to 50-100 lines each
2. WHEN implementing services THEN the system SHALL reduce service files from 800+ lines to 200-300 lines each
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL use centralized error boundaries instead of repetitive patterns
4. WHEN validating input THEN the system SHALL use Zod for inline validation instead of separate validation files
5. WHEN logging requests THEN the system SHALL remove verbose AI-generated comments and excessive logging
6. IF middleware is needed THEN the system SHALL consolidate multiple middleware files into a unified approach

### Requirement 3: Project Structure Reorganization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to reorganize the project structure into a modular architecture with core/api/modules/shared directories, so that the codebase follows modern enterprise patterns and is highly maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL use src/core/ for system-level components (database, repositories, errors, decorators)
2. WHEN implementing APIs THEN the system SHALL use src/api/ for REST and GraphQL endpoints with proper separation
3. WHEN creating features THEN the system SHALL use src/modules/ for feature-specific business logic (ecommerce, auth, cache, media, notifications, analytics, webhook)
4. WHEN creating utilities THEN the system SHALL use src/shared/ for shared utilities, middleware, config, and validators
5. WHEN managing configuration THEN the system SHALL use root-level config files (biome.json, drizzle.config.ts, vitest.config.ts)
6. IF files can be merged THEN the system SHALL combine related functionality to reduce file count while maintaining clear separation of concerns

### Requirement 4: Dual API Implementation (REST + GraphQL)

**User Story:** As a client application, I want both REST and GraphQL APIs available, so that I can choose the most appropriate API for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing GraphQL THEN the system SHALL provide schema-first GraphQL API for complex queries
2. WHEN maintaining REST THEN the system SHALL keep clean REST endpoints for simple CRUD operations
3. WHEN defining schemas THEN the system SHALL use a single source of truth for both API types
4. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL support JWT tokens for both REST and GraphQL
5. IF real-time features are needed THEN the system SHALL implement GraphQL subscriptions

### Requirement 5: Performance and Caching Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want optimized performance with intelligent caching, so that the application can handle high traffic efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing caching THEN the system SHALL use Redis with intelligent cache invalidation
2. WHEN managing database connections THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling
3. WHEN executing queries THEN the system SHALL optimize with proper indexing strategies
4. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting with Redis-based storage
5. WHEN serving responses THEN the system SHALL use compression and response optimization
6. IF API responses are cacheable THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate cache headers

### Requirement 6: Security and Authentication Enhancement

**User Story:** As a security-conscious application, I want enterprise-level security features, so that user data and system integrity are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating users THEN the system SHALL implement JWT with refresh token mechanism
2. WHEN authorizing access THEN the system SHALL use role-based access control (RBAC)
3. WHEN validating input THEN the system SHALL sanitize all inputs using Zod validation
4. WHEN preventing attacks THEN the system SHALL protect against SQL injection using Drizzle's built-in protection
5. WHEN limiting requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting per endpoint
6. IF sensitive operations occur THEN the system SHALL log security events appropriately

### Requirement 7: Development Experience and Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want 100% TypeScript coverage and excellent developer experience, so that I can develop features quickly and safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL have 100% TypeScript coverage
2. WHEN defining APIs THEN the system SHALL auto-generate API documentation
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL achieve 80% better test coverage
4. WHEN developing features THEN the system SHALL provide hot reload and fast build times
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL be Docker-ready with environment-based configuration
6. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Production Readiness

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and health checks, so that I can ensure system reliability in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints
2. WHEN tracking performance THEN the system SHALL collect and expose metrics
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement structured logging with correlation IDs
4. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL be microservice-ready with clean service boundaries
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support cloud-native deployment patterns
6. IF issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide debugging information without exposing sensitive data

### Requirement 9: File Upload and Email System Modernization

**User Story:** As an application user, I want optimized file handling and template-based emails, so that media and communication features work efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL handle file uploads with proper validation and storage
2. WHEN sending emails THEN the system SHALL use template-based email system with modern styling
3. WHEN processing media THEN the system SHALL optimize file sizes and formats
4. WHEN storing files THEN the system SHALL support cloud storage integration
5. IF email templates are needed THEN the system SHALL support dynamic content injection

### Requirement 10: Real-time Features and WebSocket Integration

**User Story:** As a real-time application, I want WebSocket support for live updates, so that users receive immediate notifications and data updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL support real-time push notifications
3. WHEN updating data THEN the system SHALL broadcast changes to connected clients
4. WHEN managing connections THEN the system SHALL handle connection lifecycle properly
